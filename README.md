About
-----

Dropyr is a simple Python utility that generates a top-down view of your Dropbox directory and constituent folders and files in a friendly ASCII view.

Dropyr currently only runs on *nix systems and requires Python 2.x or higher.

Usage
-----

Simply run:

`./Dropyr.py`

And Dropyr will take care of the rest by finding your Dropbox root directory and displaying its tree structure in ASCII.
